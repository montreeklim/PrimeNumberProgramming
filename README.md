# Prime Number Programming
This project is based on the paper **...**.
We provide an algorithm to solve a prime program (PP).

## Repository content
The repository contains the following content:
- `Code` contains all the Python code one needs to run the algorithms presented in the paper. 
## Requirements to run code
The code uses the optimization solver Gurobi and sympy package which are therefore required to run it.
